# React Picture Gallery (W10)
## Description
Duration: Weekend Project (04/28/23 - 04/30/23)

Created a Picture Gallery to view photos of movies that I love, and add the ability to "like" the picture.

This was created using React.js and hosting the server via nodemon.

-----
## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    - This is for hosting the server and communicating with the database.

-----
## Installation

1. Node Module - sweetalert2, axios, nodemon, and react.
    1. Once Node is installed, you will need to perform the following command within your terminal `npm install`.
        - This will install the node_modules folder the dependencies for the app.


2. You will need two terminals to operate the app properly.
    1. The first you will run the command `npm run server`
        - This will host the server on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/)
    2. The second you will run the command `npm run client`
        - This should open up your browser on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

## Usage

Once the page is open, you are able to view the images within the gallery.
1. To view a description of what each image represents, you can click on the image itself.
    - This will swap the image for the description.
    - To swap back to the image, just click on the description text and the image will return.
2. If you like or love a the film represented by each image, you can click on the `Love It!` button within that films card.
    - This will increase the count of message below that button.
